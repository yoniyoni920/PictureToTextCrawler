This project's need comes because I want to be able to choose a website, get specific PDF files in it that are written in Hebrew, and translate them into a usable text file (as a usable database).
To do this, Iâ€™ve created this project, which will:

2. There are already libraries that can do this.
The third, and not so important, reason is because I have never reused an entire library from GitHub and would like the experience of finding and choosing the correct library for my needs.

my chosen PDF to Text library is:
